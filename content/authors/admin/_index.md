## Biography
I'm a PhD candidate at Theis Lab working under the supervision of [Prof. Fabian J. Theis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sqWpn2AAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Institite of Computational Biology](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab), Helmholtz Munich and Technical University of Munich (TUM).

My research involves the development and application of machine learning and computational biology methods in single-cell genomics. Previously, I have received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Artificial Intelligence from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), Tehran, Iran. During my master, I focused on machine learning and deep learning in biomedical applications. I had the opportunity to be a visiting scholar at Mcgill University, School of Computer Science working with [Dr. Yue Li](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~yueli/) and research assistant at [Computer Aided Medical Procedures Lab](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/start/), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Nassir Navab](https://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavabCv).
Now I am a team lead data scientist at [Hengam.io](https://hengam.io/) where we build and develop AI-based E-commerce solutions for [Shopify](https://shopify.com/) merchants to grow their business.
